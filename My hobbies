I have a few hobbies which I am going to describe in the document.

Astronomy: This is probably my oldest hobby. It was my Dad's hobby and I got it from him. I remember when I was a very little kid (may be 
2 ~ 3 years old), my Dad started to show me the night sky. Sometimes when he was taking me out on his bicycle during evening after dark, he 
would stop his bicycle on the side of the road and show me planets, constellations and bright stars.
